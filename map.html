    <h2>Map-Mughal Mint towns
    </h2>



    <p>This image is a map of the Mughal Mint towns. The Mughal empire extended in the entire South Asia extending from some parts of Afghanistan to the entire present India, Pakistan. <br><br> The Mughal Realm was established by Babur (ruled 1526â€“1530), a Central Asian ruler who was slipped from the Turco-Mongol victor Timur (the originator of the Timurid Realm) on his father's side, and from Genghis Khan on his mother's side. Removed from his genealogical spaces in Central Asia, Babur turned to India to fulfill his desire. He set up himself in Kabul and after that pushed consistently southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces crushed Ibrahim Lodhi within the To begin with Fight of Panipat. Some time recently the fight, Babur looked for divine support by abjuring alcohol, breaking the wine vessels, and pouring the wine down a well. Be that as it may, by this time Lodhi's domain was as of now disintegrating, and it was really the Rajput Confederacy that was the most grounded control in Northern India beneath the able rule of Rana Sanga of Mewar. He crushed Babar within the Fight of Bayana. In a conclusive fight battled close Agra, the Timurid strengths of Babur crushed the Rajput and established Mughal empire in the region. </p>
