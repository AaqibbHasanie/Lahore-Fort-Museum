    <h2>Mughal soldiers' curved swords</h2>


    <p>These curved swords were used by Mughal soldiers during the Mughal rule which presided in the subcontinent for more than 300 years. A major identification of a Mughal sword is its curviness which distinguishes it from other soldiers' weapons. These swords are placed inside armory gallery and blood stains are also visible on these swords. It is said that blood stains are a symbol of Mughal bravery. Mughals also used these swords during their initial attacks in the subcontinent in 1500s. The Mughals used these swords for various purposes including torturing culprits, attacking enemies, self-defense and during wars. The Mughals also poisoned these swords with various snake venoms and chemicals as a result of which these swords were one of the mosy fatal weapons during wars.</p>
