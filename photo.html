    <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold ;">last surviving member</span> of the dynasty that had governed the <span style="font-weight: bold ;">Sikh Empire</span> in the Punjab was Princess Bamba Sutherland. She was born on <span style="font-weight: bold ;">29 September 1869</span> and died on  <span style="font-weight: bold ;">10 March 1957.</span> She was raised in England before going to Lahore, the former capital of her father's empire. She developed into a strong supporter of India's independence and self-government there. She entertained Indian rebels like <span style="font-weight: bold ;">Lala Lajpat Rai</span> and grew close to them. <br> <br> Bamba's father was persuasively isolated from his mother and raised as a Christian. Duleep, who returned from her mother's burial service in India, hitched an ill-conceived child who worked at a teacher school in Cairo. He took Bamba's mother back to Britain as her spouse, lived her extravagant life and was known to her Ruler Victoria. Bamba is her eldest girl, named after her mother, her maternal grandma, and her fatherly grandma, respectively. The title "Bamba" implies "pink" in Arabic. Her mother was raised in Cairo and was of German and Abyssinian plunge. After Bamba's father was taken absent from her, Bamba's grandma <span style="font-weight: bold ;">Jind Kaur</span> fled India to Nepal, where she lived in destitution. At last, she was permitted to return to her child in Britain. Duleep picked her up with her uncommon authorization. Duleep gotten consent from the UK to return to India to bury her cinders after her mother passed on there.</p>
