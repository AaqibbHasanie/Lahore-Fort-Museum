    <p>The shelves to the left of the Map contians several letters and details related to the Sikh and the Mughal emperors. These shelves also contain Farman of Emperor Jehangir for the award of a Jagir to s saint known as Shaikh Umar Hussain in the Paraqna Sambhal. <br><br>Jehangir, original name Nūr al-Dīn Muḥammad Salīm, (born August 31, 1569, Fatehpur Sikri [India]—died October 28, 1627, en route to Lahore [now in Pakistan]), Mughal emperor of India from 1605 to 1627.

Prince Salīm was the eldest son of the emperor Akbar, who early marked Salīm to succeed him. Impatient for power, however, Salīm revolted in 1599 while Akbar was engaged in the Deccan. Akbar on his deathbed confirmed Salīm as his successor. The new emperor chose the Persian name Jahāngīr (“World Seizer”) as his reign name.</p>
