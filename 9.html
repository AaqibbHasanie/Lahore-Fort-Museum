    <h2>Musical instruments used during Sikh rule</h2>


    <p>One of the well-known talents of the Sikh and Mughal times was the Musical tones that they could produce in the court of the king. The musicians utilized various instruments such as dhools, sitars and dafs to produce extra-ordinary sounds that no musician can even produce today. The dhools present in above image were mostly used by Sikh and Mughal musicians to welcome guests and please the king. The masterpieces produced in the court of Sikh and Mughal empires are still unmatchable. <br>Other musical instruments including accompaniments are also present which were used by Britain soldiers mainly.</p>
